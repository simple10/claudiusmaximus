# 98 - Post-Deploy: First Access & Device Pairing

Interactive guide for accessing OpenClaw and pairing your first device after deployment.

## Overview

After `07-verification.md` confirms all services are healthy, this playbook walks you through:

- Retrieving the gateway access token
- Opening the OpenClaw UI for the first time
- Approving your first device pairing request
- Verifying the connection works end-to-end

## Prerequisites

- `07-verification.md` completed successfully
- OpenClaw gateway running on VPS-1
- Networking (Cloudflare Tunnel or Caddy) configured and active
- Browser available on your local machine

---

## 98.1 Retrieve Gateway Token

Read the gateway token from VPS-1:

```bash
ssh -i <SSH_KEY_PATH> -p <SSH_PORT> <SSH_USER>@<VPS1_IP> \
  "sudo grep OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN /home/openclaw/openclaw/.env | cut -d= -f2"
```

Construct and present the access URL to the user:

```
https://<DOMAIN_OPENCLAW><SUBPATH_OPENCLAW>/chat?token=<TOKEN>
```

> **Note:** If `SUBPATH_OPENCLAW` is empty in `openclaw-config.env`, the URL is simply `https://<DOMAIN_OPENCLAW>/chat?token=<TOKEN>`.

---

## 98.2 Open the URL

Tell the user to open the URL in their browser.

**Expected behavior:** The browser will connect to the gateway. Because this is a new (unpaired) device, the gateway will close the WebSocket connection with code `1008: pairing required`. The UI will show a "disconnected" or "pairing required" message. This is normal.

**If the page doesn't load at all (connection error or timeout):**

1. Check the tunnel/Caddy is running:
   - Cloudflare Tunnel: `ssh ... "sudo systemctl status cloudflared"`
   - Caddy: `ssh ... "sudo docker ps | grep caddy"`
2. Check the gateway is running: `ssh ... "sudo docker ps | grep openclaw-gateway"`
3. Check gateway logs: `ssh ... "sudo docker logs --tail 20 openclaw-gateway"`
4. Verify DNS is resolving to the correct destination

Ask the user to confirm they can see the page (even with the pairing error) before proceeding.

---

## 98.3 Approve Device Pairing

After the user confirms they opened the URL, approve their device:

### List pending device requests

```bash
ssh -i <SSH_KEY_PATH> -p <SSH_PORT> <SSH_USER>@<VPS1_IP> \
  "sudo docker exec openclaw-gateway node dist/index.js devices list"
```

This will show pending pairing requests. Find the most recent one (should be seconds old, matching when the user opened the URL).

### Approve the request

```bash
ssh -i <SSH_KEY_PATH> -p <SSH_PORT> <SSH_USER>@<VPS1_IP> \
  "sudo docker exec openclaw-gateway node dist/index.js devices approve <requestId>"
```

Replace `<requestId>` with the ID from the list output.

Tell the user to wait approximately 15 seconds — the browser will automatically retry the connection and should connect successfully once the device is approved.

### If no pending requests appear

- Pending requests have a **5-minute TTL**. If the user waited too long, the request may have expired. Ask them to refresh the page and re-run `devices list`.
- Each browser retry creates a new pending request, so there may be multiple. Approve the most recent one.

---

## 98.4 Verify Connection

Ask the user to confirm:

1. The UI now shows a **connected** status (no more "pairing required" or "disconnected")
2. They can see the **chat interface** and interact with it

**If still not connecting after approval:**

```bash
# Check gateway logs for auth/pairing errors
ssh -i <SSH_KEY_PATH> -p <SSH_PORT> <SSH_USER>@<VPS1_IP> \
  "sudo docker logs --tail 30 openclaw-gateway"

# Re-list devices to confirm approval went through
ssh -i <SSH_KEY_PATH> -p <SSH_PORT> <SSH_USER>@<VPS1_IP> \
  "sudo docker exec openclaw-gateway node dist/index.js devices list"
```

If the device shows as approved but the browser still can't connect, ask the user to hard-refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R) and try again.

## Troubleshooting

### "Connection refused" when opening the URL

- Tunnel or Caddy is not running, or DNS is not configured correctly.
- Check `07-verification.md` section 7.6 for networking verification steps.

### Token is rejected (401/403)

- The token in the URL may not match `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` in the `.env` file.
- Re-read the token from VPS-1 and try again.

### No pending devices after opening URL

- The page may not have fully loaded or attempted a WebSocket connection.
- Check browser developer console for errors.
- Ensure the URL includes the correct token parameter.

### Device approved but still "disconnected"

- Hard-refresh the browser page.
- Check gateway logs for errors after the approval.
- Verify the gateway container hasn't restarted: `sudo docker ps | grep openclaw-gateway`
