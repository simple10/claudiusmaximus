# Plans

This directory is meant as working memory for claude plans.

IMPORTANT: AGENTS should ignore this directory unless explicitly told to read a plan file.

The dir is in .claudeignore

## Organization

- [Queued](_queued/): plans that have been approved and are waiting to be implemented
- [In Development](1_development/): plans being iterated on, typically because the first pass didn't successfully implement the feature
- [Implemented](2_implemented/): plans that have been applied to the project and VPS's
- [Under Consideration](3_consideration/): possible future plans, these are not ready for implementation but worth saving
