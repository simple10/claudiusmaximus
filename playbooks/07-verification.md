# 07 - Verification & Testing

Comprehensive verification procedures after deployment.

## Overview

This playbook verifies:

- OpenClaw gateway functionality
- Vector log shipping
- Cloudflare Workers health
- End-to-end connectivity

## Prerequisites

- All previous playbooks completed
- 05-cloudflare-tunnel.md completed
- Workers deployed (08-workers.md)
- VPS-1 rebooted after configuration

## Pre-Verification: Reboot VPS-1

Before running verification tests, reboot VPS-1 to ensure all configuration changes take effect cleanly (especially kernel parameters, SSH config, and systemd services).

```bash
sudo reboot
```

Wait 1-2 minutes for VPS-1 to come back online, then verify SSH access:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/ovh_openclaw_ed25519 -p 222 adminclaw@<VPS1-IP> "echo 'VPS-1 online'"
```

---

## 7.1 Verify OpenClaw (VPS-1)

```bash
# Check containers are running
cd /home/openclaw/openclaw
sudo -u openclaw docker compose ps

# Check gateway logs for errors
sudo docker logs --tail 50 openclaw-gateway

# Test internal endpoint
curl -s http://localhost:18789/ | head -5

# Test health endpoint
curl -s http://localhost:18789/health
```

**Expected:** All containers running, health endpoint returns OK.

---

## 7.2 Verify Vector (Log Shipping)

```bash
# Check Vector is running
sudo -u openclaw docker compose ps vector

# Check Vector logs for errors
sudo docker logs --tail 20 vector

# Check checkpoint data exists
ls -la /home/openclaw/openclaw/data/vector/
```

**Expected:** Vector running, no errors in logs, checkpoint files present.

---

## 7.3 Verify Cloudflare Workers

### Log Receiver Worker

```bash
# Health check (no auth required)
curl -s https://<LOG_WORKER_URL>/health

# Test log ingestion (replace with your actual URL and token)
curl -X POST https://<LOG_WORKER_URL>/logs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <LOG_WORKER_TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"container_name":"test","message":"verification test","stream":"stdout","timestamp":"2026-01-01T00:00:00Z"}'
```

**Expected:** Health returns `{"status":"ok"}`, log ingestion returns `{"status":"ok","count":1}`.

### AI Gateway Worker

```bash
# Health check
curl -s https://<AI_GATEWAY_WORKER_URL>/health
```

**Expected:** Returns `{"status":"ok"}`.

### Verify Logs in Cloudflare Dashboard

1. Go to **Cloudflare Dashboard** -> **Workers & Pages** -> **log-receiver** -> **Logs**
2. Check for the test log entry sent above
3. Check for container logs flowing from Vector

---

## 7.4 Verify External Access (Cloudflare Tunnel)

```bash
# On VPS-1, verify tunnel is running
sudo systemctl status cloudflared

# Test external access (from any machine)
curl -s https://claw.example.com<OPENCLAW_DOMAIN_PATH>/ | head -5

# Verify direct IP access is blocked
curl -sk --connect-timeout 5 https://<VPS1-IP>/ || echo "Direct access blocked (expected)"
```

---

## 7.5 Verify Host Alerter

```bash
# Test the alerter script manually (should not send alerts if everything is healthy)
sudo /home/openclaw/scripts/host-alert.sh
echo $?  # Should be 0

# Check cron job is installed
cat /etc/cron.d/openclaw-alerts
```

**Expected:** Script exits 0 with no errors, cron entry exists.

## 7.6 Security Checklist

### VPS-1

- [ ] SSH on port 222 only (port 22 removed from UFW)
- [ ] SSH key-only authentication (password disabled)
- [ ] Only `adminclaw` user can SSH (AllowUsers directive)
- [ ] UFW enabled with minimal rules (SSH only)
- [ ] Fail2ban running
- [ ] No WireGuard interface present

```bash
# Verify on VPS-1
sudo ufw status
sudo systemctl status fail2ban
ss -tlnp | grep 222
ip link show wg0 2>&1 | grep -q "does not exist" && echo "No WireGuard (correct)"
```

### VPS-1 Services

- [ ] OpenClaw gateway running
- [ ] Sysbox runtime available
- [ ] Vector shipping logs
- [ ] Backup cron job configured
- [ ] Host alerter cron job configured

```bash
sudo systemctl status sysbox
sudo -u openclaw docker compose ps
sudo docker logs --tail 5 vector
cat /etc/cron.d/openclaw-backup
cat /etc/cron.d/openclaw-alerts
```

### Cloudflare Workers

- [ ] AI Gateway Worker responding
- [ ] Log Receiver Worker responding
- [ ] Logs appearing in Cloudflare Workers dashboard

---

## 7.7 End-to-End Test

1. **Access OpenClaw** via configured domain
2. **Send a test message** via webchat
3. **Verify LLM response** comes back (confirms AI Gateway Worker routing)
4. **Check Cloudflare AI Gateway dashboard** for the request (Workers & Pages -> AI Gateway)
5. **Check Cloudflare Workers logs** for container log entries (Workers & Pages -> log-receiver -> Logs)

---

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

### Container Issues

```bash
sudo -u openclaw docker compose ps
sudo -u openclaw docker compose logs -f <service>
docker system df
free -h
```

### Vector Issues

```bash
# Check Vector logs
sudo docker logs --tail 50 vector

# Restart Vector
sudo -u openclaw docker compose restart vector

# Check if Worker endpoint is reachable
curl -s https://<LOG_WORKER_URL>/health
```

### Networking Issues

```bash
ss -tlnp                          # List listening ports
curl -v http://localhost:PORT/    # Test local connectivity
sudo ufw status                   # Check firewall rules
```

### Service Not Starting After Reboot

```bash
sudo systemctl status <service>
sudo systemctl enable <service>
sudo journalctl -u <service> -f
```
