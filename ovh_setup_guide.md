# OVHCloud Setup Guide for OpenClaw Deployment

This guide covers the manual steps you need to complete before handing off to Claude Code.

---

## Overview

You'll be setting up **a VPS instance** on OVHCloud:

| VPS | Purpose | Hostname | IP (example) |
|-----|---------|----------|--------------|
| VPS-1 | OpenClaw (gateway + sandboxes) | `openclaw` | `51.x.x.1` |

---

## Step 1: Create OVHCloud Account

1. Go to [us.ovhcloud.com](https://us.ovhcloud.com) (or your regional OVHCloud site)
2. Create an account or log in
3. Add a payment method
4. Verify your email and identity if prompted

---

## Step 2: Generate a New SSH Key

You will need the public key during the checkout flow for OVH.

If you do not add the public key during checkout, it can be added after provisioning by
reinstalling the OS in the OVH dashboard.

```bash
# On your local machine
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "ovh-openclaw-vps" -f ~/.ssh/ovh_openclaw_ed25519
# Enter a secure password when prompted, used to decrypt the local private key
# Securely store the password, you'll need it for ssh-add step later on

# Update permissions for all local keys
chmod -R 600 ~/.ssh/*

# View public key to paste into OVHCloud
cat ~/.ssh/ovh_openclaw_ed25519.pub
```

## Step 3: Order a VPS Instance

1. Navigate to **Bare Metal & VPS → VPS**
2. Click **Configure your VPS** or select **VPS-2** ($6.75/mo)
3. Configure:

   | Setting | Value |
   |---------|-------|
   | **Model** | VPS-2 (6 vCores, 12GB RAM, 100GB NVMe) |
   | **Location** | Choose a **standard datacenter** (not Local Zone) — e.g., Vint Hill VA, Hillsboro OR, or EU |
   | **Operating System** | **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS** |
   | **SSH Key** | Add your public SSH key |
   | **Hostname** | `openclaw` |

---

## Step 4: Wait for Provisioning

OVHCloud typically provisions VPSs within 5-15 minutes. You'll receive:

- Email confirmation with IP addresses
- Access credentials in OVHCloud Control Panel

### Find Your IPs

1. Log into [OVHCloud Control Panel](https://manager.us.ovhcloud.com)
2. Go to **Bare Metal Cloud → VPS**
3. Note the **IPv4 address** for your VPS

Record it in openclaw-config.env:

```bash
# openclaw-config.env

VPS1_IP=15.x.x.x
VPS1_HOSTNAME=openclaw

# SSH Configuration (required)
SSH_KEY_PATH=~/.ssh/ovh_openclaw_ed25519 # Path to your ssh key generated in Step 2
SSH_USER=ubuntu # This is the initial user created by OVH, it will get changed to admin claw during hardening
SSH_PORT=22 # Initial SSH port, will get changed to 222 during hardening
```

---

## Step 5: Verify SSH Access

Test SSH access to VPS-1 from your local machine:

```bash
# Add ssh key for local sessions - needed for claude to do it's work
ssh-add ~/.ssh/ovh_openclaw_ed25519

# Test VPS-1 (OpenClaw)
ssh -i ~/.ssh/ovh_openclaw_ed25519 ubuntu@<VPS-1-IP>
```

On first connection, accept the host key fingerprint.

### Troubleshooting SSH

If you can't connect:

1. **Check firewall**: OVHCloud VPSs should have port 22 open by default
2. **Check username**: Ubuntu 24.04 uses `ubuntu` as the default user
3. **Use KVM console**: In OVHCloud Control Panel, click your VPS → **KVM** to access directly

---

## Step 6: Verify System Requirements

SSH into your VPS and run these checks:

```bash
# Check Ubuntu version (should be 24.04)
lsb_release -a

# Check kernel version (should be 6.x)
uname -r

# Check available RAM
free -h

# Check disk space
df -h

# Check CPU info
nproc
```

Expected output:

- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- Kernel 6.x (e.g., 6.8.0-xx)
- ~12GB RAM
- ~100GB disk
- 6 vCores

---

### Step 7: Continue with Steps in [README.md](./README.md)

Finish the setup steps in README.md and hand off to claude to implement.

---

## Quick Reference

### SSH Commands

**Note**: After deployment, SSH uses port 222 (not 22). During initial setup, use the default port 22.

```bash
# Add ssh key for local sessions - needed for claude to do it's work
ssh-add ~/.ssh/ovh_openclaw_ed25519

# SSH to OpenClaw VPS (before deployment - default port 22)
ssh -i ~/.ssh/ovh_openclaw_ed25519 ubuntu@<VPS-1-IP>

# After claude deployment and hardening - use port 222 and adminclaw user
ssh -i ~/.ssh/ovh_openclaw_ed25519 -p 222 adminclaw@<VPS-1-IP>
```
