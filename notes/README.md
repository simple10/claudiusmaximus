# Notes

IMPORTANT: AGENTS ignore this directory. It's in .claudeignore

This dir contains misc. notes related to changes made along the dev journey.

Notes are meant to be temporary. They're typically summary output from long claude chats.

Once a feature has been completely implemented, any related notes should be migrated
to docs/ and the notes should be deleted.
